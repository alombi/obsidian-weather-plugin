# Weather Plugin
A simple plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) that shows in the status bar the current weather for a certain location.


## Installation
1. Download `main.js` and `manifest.json` from the latest GitHub release
2. Create a folder in your vault's `.obsidian/plugins` folder called "weather-plugin"
3. Then copy and paste the `main.js` and `manifest.json` files into the new folder
4. Activate Weather Plugin (make sure you disabled *Safe mode* in the community plugin tab)
## Setting up
**Important**: the plugin will need an [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org) API key (free plan) for working. The key can be inserted in the plugin's setting in Obsidian

## Limitations
Weather Plugin does not work on mobile, since Obsidian's status bar isn't supported on said devices.
