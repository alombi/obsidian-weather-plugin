# Weather Plugin
A simple plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) that shows in the status bar the current weather for a certain location.


## Installation
This plugin is not available in the offical store, so you need to install it manually by downloading the latest release here on GitHub.

**Important**: the plugin will need an [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org) API key (free plan) for working. The key can be inserted in the plugin's setting in Obsidian

## Limitations
Weather Plugin does not work on mobile, since Obsidian's status bar isn't supported on said devices.
